A bot with GPT3, LangChain, and Python.

# Install

## Requirements

Developed and tested on [Python 3.8](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Also, although it is not strictly required, the usage of a [virtualenv](
https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/latest/) is highly recommended in order to avoid
interfering with other software installed in the system.
